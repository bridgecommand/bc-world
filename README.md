This is a repository to develop new world areas for Bridge Command.
The technical specification for world models can be found at https://www.bridgecommand.co.uk/Doc/WorldFileSpec.php (for version 5.x). If you are still using Bridge Command 4.7, please see https://www.bridgecommand.co.uk/Doc/4.7/WorldFileSpec.php

To contribute a new world model, please fork this repository, and add your world model folder under 5.x (for the current Bridge Command version), or 4.x (for earlier version). When you have done this, please commit and make a pull request, so I can merge your changes into this repository. Please indicate the copyright status of the data used to create the world model.
